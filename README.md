Hi! I'm Khanh Nguyen, a Philosophy Student at the University of Edinburgh. While I am a Philosophy Student, I am also interested in Mathematics. In fact, that was my degree programme before I switched tracks! I came into Mathematics to answer why and how proofs work. I came to the wrong place; they don't care about any of that. Philosophy was where I should have been. While I do enjoy Mathematics, I don't enjoy it enough to do it for its own sake. Hence, the switch to Philosophy. Enough waffling, here is what you are going to find on my GitHub.

- Essays for Classes I have taken

- Maths Notes

- Miscellaneous Stuff
