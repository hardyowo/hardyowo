Hi! I'm Khanh Nguyen, a Philosophy Student at the University of Edinburgh. While I am a Philosophy Student, I am also interested in Mathematics. In fact, that was my degree programme before I switched tracks! I came into Mathematics to answer why and how proofs work. I came to the wrong place; they don't care about any of that. Philosophy was where I should have been. While I do enjoy Mathematics, I don't enjoy it enough to do it for its own sake. Hence, the switch to Philosophy among other reasons. Enough waffling, this GitHub contains essays for classes I have taken, maths notes, and whatever else I feel like.
