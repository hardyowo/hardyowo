Hi, I'm hardyowo, a Philosophy Student at the University of Edinburgh. While I am a Philosophy Student, I am also very interested in Mathematics. In fact, that was my degree programme before I switched tracks! Unfortunately, I am more interested in Philosophy than Mathematics. Mathematics got the short end of the stick. Enough waffling, here is what you are going to find on my GitHub.

- Essays for Classes I have taken

- Maths Notes

- Miscellaneous Stuff
